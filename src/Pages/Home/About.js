            WTL Token is your gateway to participating in World Trading Leagues
            at discounted rates. You can use these tokens to pay for your league
            fees, making it more affordable to join the competitions.
            Additionally, all referral rewards and league prizes are paid out in
            WTL Tokens, so the more you participate and engage with the
            community, the more tokens you can earn. Community members and token
            holders can also use WTL Tokens to purchase official World Trading
            Leagues merchandise and accessories at special discounted prices.
            This adds another layer of utility to the tokens, making them more
            than just a tool for trading and investing.
